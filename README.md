# Express-Semver

This is just a simple middleware for semver-style API versioning with express. This uses isaacs [semver](http://github.com/isaacs/node-semver) module, so all the same versioning string rules apply as npm itself.

## Install

    npm install express-semver

## Usage

    // Blanket version a whole server
    var basic = express()
    basic.use(ver.gte('0.0.0'))
    basic.get('/', function (req, res) {
      res.send('Hello, World')
    })
    server.use('/basic', basic)

    // Or version per-route
    var complex = express()
    complex.get('/', ver.gte('0.0.0'), function (req, res) {
      res.send('Hello, World')
    })
    server.use('/complex', complex)

## API

### ver.satisfies|gt|gte|lt|lte|eq|neq
Returns a middleware that restricts continuation with express if the specified "Version" header is not set. It can be used both with use() or in the flow of any route definition.
